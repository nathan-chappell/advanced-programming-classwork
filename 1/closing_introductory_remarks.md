## Brief history of this class
* C++ club
* Last year's lectures
* * I thought *I* did a decent job presenting some rather advanced material
* * I'm not sure I accomplished my goal

**I didn't yet know what my goal was!**

*Side Notes:*
* In general, we got bogged down in some low-level stuff, in particular the assembler code when trying to understand virtual functions in `C++`.
* It's not that the students *couldn't* follow, it's just that the harsh reality of code at that level is that it's foreign.  It's designed to solve problems that don't occur to the typical programmer -- truly testament to its creators.
* I needed a simpler environment to demonstrate the concepts, that's what I'm still in the process of creating...

## The goal of this class

* I told Mislav (former student) that the "true" measure of a course should be what you can accomplish after that you couldn't before, and it wasn't clear to me what that was.
* It wasn't clear to me what I was even doing.
* Maybe instead of me answering this question, I should ask you all

**Why are you here?**

* I have noticed some disturbing trends in the industry
* * Laziness / Over-pragmatic behavior
* * Lack of passion
* * Here is what I wrote my boss:

> I want to be involved in this if I will be at all involved in working on frontend.  I've seen a lot of really shitty libraries chosen for various tasks in other projects, and in general it seems like JS guys have a tendency to pick shitty libraries that make a very simple task easy, and then makes doing others things an absolute nightmare.
> I don't know if I can really blame our JS guys for that, it seems like this is a very trendy thing to do of JS devs (make a library that is good for one use case, but it's adoption fucks you over).

I *want* to give you these skills I've been working on:
* Programming language analysis
* Identifying important abstractions and important aspects of their implementations

I *can't* give you:
* Interest

I *won't* give you:
* Motivation
